Visual Studio Code 

- Focused around workspaces or folders
- A workspace is a file which contains references to multiple folders
- VSCode always has an undefined workspace if you have a folder open
- You can add a project to the current workspace at any time
- You might use different folders for e.g.
  - an html website
  - code for an application
  - database code for your database
- in general you would probably organise all of the above types of things in a single folder but there is no definitve approach for this. A decision around organisation of resources needs to be made to support the way you work. The main crieria you should apply is "can you explain it clearly to someone else?"
- vscode supports many extensions - regardless of what language you are using there is likely to be an extension which supports it - for some languages there are many extensions
- extensions are code which executes on your system - be careful in which ones you select, and prefer ones which are well used by others, well documented and\or are from reputable sources
- The major functionality for vscode is fairly simpel - it is either
  - in the menus, i.e. File, Edit, Selection etc at the top of the window
  - the toolbar on the left side of the window which will show you views of the different function. These include;
    - Explorer - shows a view of the files in you folder or workspace
    - Search - provides a place to search in your resources
    - Source Control - supports versioning and sharing of work (we will not use this in this year)
    - Debugger - can be used for controlling and testing the execution of programs
    - Extensions - which allows you to browse and view extensions which are available or installed
    - For more on the vscode layout see 
- There is a lot of material on the internet supporting vscode - use Google and perhaps start with Microsoft's vscode documentation at https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs
